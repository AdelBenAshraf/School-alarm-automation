# School-alarm-automation
In this project I am trying to automate the school alarm using Arduino, RTC clock module and a relay. You will find the RTC library in this project as well as how to set the time for the module and the finished code for the project.

You can find the RTC Library in the following link: https://github.com/chrisfryer78/ArduinoRTClibrary.git

Download the library as a zip then unzip it in the libraries folder in the arduino folder.
How to find the libraries folder: This PC --> C --> Program Files (x86) --> Arduino --> libraries.
Then delete the zip folder or keep it if you want.
